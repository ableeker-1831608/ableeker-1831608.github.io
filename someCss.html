		<h1>A paragraph about me! I've lived in Snohomish all my life and have always wanted to go to the University of Washington. It's nice for me because I'm close enough to home that I can go home on the weekends, but I'm also far enough away to have some of my own independence.</h1>
		<p>Something that I miss about home is my dog, Haley. She's a Havanese which is essentially a Maltese. She's really cute and the best part is that she doesn't shed!</p>

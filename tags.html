		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm a Sophomore at the University of Washington in Seattle! I grew up in 
		Snohomish, Washington (just a little North of here) and have always wanted 
		to go to UW.</p>
		<p>I currently want to study Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology,
		however, I haven't applied to my major yet as I'm currently taking the Biology 
		180 class. In addition to this, I'm also taking Organic Chemistry this quarter,
		which is going to be a little rough but I'll make it through.</p>
		<p>Some things I like to do in my free time is to play tennis, hang out with 
		friends, and go exploring. There's so many beautiful places to go and see in
		Seattle, even though I've been living here my whole life, there's always something
		new.</p>
